This javascript generator aims to create and make it easier to create your javascript objects based on the CRUD structure.

<br><br>
I made a simple UI to make it more fun while generating your code.
<br><br>
You should fill the "Variable name" which is the object you want to create.
<br><br>
The "property's name" is required ... These are the properties of your generate object.
<br><br>
The "property's value" can be empty , It's set to undefined by default.
<br><br>
Adding more properties will increment the property counter on "Add property" button . Which makes it easier to create your object! 
<br><br>
Once you've set it all , you can generate it by clicking "generate" and voila . You have now a easily created CRUD based object.
<br><br>
You can now use your 1 min generated object :)
